# Real-time bus tracker
Simulates a bus route from MIT to Harvard. Once the bus finishes its route, you can press the `show stops` button again to reset the marker position.

## How to run
1. pull the project locally
2. get a Mapbox api key from [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token/)
3. add an .env file with the key `MAPBOX` and set its value to your api key
4. run `index.html`

## Roadmap of future improvements
- Diversify map options
- display a timeline of stops
- let user navigate back and forth between stops
